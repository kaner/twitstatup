Note that you need to set up your Twitter account to accept 3rd party apps
to post to it in your settings. There you will receive a consumer key and a
consumer secret from Twitter. Use those to fill in CONSUMER_KEY and 
CONSUMER_SECRET below.

The next thing you need is your token key and token secret. The easiest way
to get those is to follow the 'three legged oauth' here:

          https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2

Also use this URL to fetch the python-oauth2 library. You need it to run this
script.

Fill them into TOKEN_KEY and TOKEN_SECRET below. Now you're all set to post
on Twitter via this script. Have fun!
